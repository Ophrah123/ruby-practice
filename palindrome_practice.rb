'''
You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.
Return the shuffled string.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
Example 2:
Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.
 
Constraints:
s.length == indices.length == n
1 <= n <= 100
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
0 <= indices[i] < n
All values of indices are unique.
'''

# @param {String} s
# @return {Boolean}

Goal1: Psuedocode
1. Initialize result variable to an empty array
2. Change string s to all lowercase values
3. Use an if statement to verify that the length of indices is 1 <= n <= 100
4. Accept string s and an integer array indices if length of s and indices are equal to each other.
5. Create a for loop for string s that outputs each letter at integer array indices and use the join function to put all string output together.
6. Append the results of the for loop to the result variable
'''

'''
Goal2:
1. Result is equal to an empty array
2. string s ="codeleet"" before downcase function and removing 
   all non-alphanumeric characters string s = "amanaplanacanalpanama"
3. if 1<= indices <=100 true
    4. if the length of string s == the length of indices true
        5. 
            5.
