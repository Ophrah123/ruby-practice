'''
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

Goal1: Psuedocode
1. Initialize result variable to an empty array
2. Change string s to all lowercase values
3. Use an if statement to verify that the length of indices is 1 <= n <= 100
4. Accept string s and an integer array indices if length of s and indices are equal to each other.
5. Create a for loop for string s that outputs each letter at integer array indices and use the join function to put all string output together.
6. Append the results of the for loop to the result variable

Goal2:
1. Result is equal to an empty array
2. string s ="A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" before downcase function string s = "amanaplanacanalpanama"
3. if 1<= indices <=100 true
    4. if the length of string s == the length of indices true
